# `status_lib`

> A tiny library with functions to declare status checks and register them in a
> centralized place.

## Usage

Ensure `status_lib` is included in the dependencies and started by including it
in the `applications` key of your `<application>.app{.src}` file.

In your `<application>_app.erl` module, register a module that implements the
`status_lib` behaviour by calling `status_lib:register(<module>).`

The `status_lib` behaviour has a single required callback: `status/0`, which
should return a list of `status_item()`. These can be generated by calling
`status_lib` functions to setup checks.
